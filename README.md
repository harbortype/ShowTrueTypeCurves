# Show TrueType Curves

This is a plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](https://glyphsapp.com/).  

This reporter plugin draws the contents of the active layer as quadratic curves in the background. This will give you an idea of how the points will be when exporting as TTF.

Keep in mind this is not the same conversion Glyphs does when exporting the fonts, so the results may vary a bit.
